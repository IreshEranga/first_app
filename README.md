# first_app

A new Flutter project.
I developed this project by following the Flutter Crash Course for Absolute Beginners by Coding with T. This comprehensive tutorial series provided me with the foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary to build this application. I highly recommend this resource to anyone interested in learning Flutter from the ground up.

For more information about the tutorial series, you can visit the Flutter Crash Course for Absolute Beginners playlist on YouTube.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.


A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
